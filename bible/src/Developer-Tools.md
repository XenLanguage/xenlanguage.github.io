At the moment, Xen doesn't have an available language server. It does provide two editor extensions that provide basic syntax highlighting for VS Code and Neovim.

- [Download (VS Code)](https://github.com/XenLanguage/Xen-VSCode) (Install with `Developer > Install Extension from Directory`)
- [Download (Neovim)](https://github.com/XenLanguage/Xen-Neovim)
