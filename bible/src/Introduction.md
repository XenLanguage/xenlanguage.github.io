# Introduction

Xen is a loosely-typed, imperative scripting language written in C. Its syntax closesly resembles C-like languages and the bytecode compiler and VM is a mere 70Kb in total. Its primary purpose is to serve as a learning project for myself and a fun side project to work on in my free time. **It is not designed with the intent of being a serious, production-ready language.**

With that being said, this guide serves as a hopefully-useful overview of Xen and its current offerings.
