# Introduction

Xen is a loosely-typed, imperative scripting language written in C. Its syntax closely resembles C-like languages and the interpreter itself is a mere 120 Kb in size. Its primary purpose is to serve as a learning project for myself and a fun side project to work on in my free time. **It is not designed with the intent of being a serious, production-ready language**.

With that being said, this guide serves as a hopefully-useful overview of Xen and its current offerings.
